# TDS_Imposto

## I. INTRODUCTION (in portuguese)
Uma tentativa de reimplementar um código para calcular o quanto você foi taxado para a disciplina de Testes de Software lecionada pela Dra. Profa. Elaine Venson no semestre de 2025.1

A implementação original é de autoria do Dr. Prof. André Lana. 

A licença desse código foi configurada para ser uma gplv3, mas não tenho certeza em como o código original foi licenciado. 

Os comentários utilizaram o LSCM (Locvst's Standard Censoring Method) para evitar qualquer problema relacionado às profanidades que usualmente ocorrem.

No mais, a partir desse ponto, incluindo o commit que originalmente modificou esse readme, a linguagem padrão utilizada será !inglês!.
This was deliberately done so I may practice my english. And for funnies, of course. I do hope Mrs. E. doesn't get very mad. Or take 
away my grades. I do need those grades. 

## II. INTRODUCTION (in LSCM censored profanity)

DAMN! EVER WONDERED HOW MUCH YOU'RE GONNA GET ALPHA FOXTROTED THIS YEAR? WONDER NO MORE!

WITH TDS_IMPOSTO, YOU'RE NOW ABLE TO FIND JUST HOW MUCH THE BRAVO GOLF WILL SIERRA ECHO PHANTOM OSCAR OSCAR YANKEE PHANTOM! 

FEAR NOT! INDIA YANKEE GOLF NOVEMBER MIKE TANGO PHANTOM TANGO ALPHA ALPHA THIS WILL GENERATE, YOU ARE CORDIALLY INVITED TO ECHO SIERRA ALPHA DELTA :)!

YOU COULD "FOXTROT YANKEE FOXTROT WHISKEY TANGO MIKE" AND MIGHT ALSO LIVE A GENERALLY "BRAVO ALPHA MIKE CHARLIE LIMA", YOU MIGHT PROTEST. WELL, BAD LUCK! YOU OSCAR UNIFORM YANKEE SIERRA!!
EVERY. CHARLIE! EVERY PHANTOM. 

That's mostly it for introductions.

## III. Methodology

To prove I do am using the TDD methodology, every function implemented will have its own commit. Kinda sucks and kinda needs more discipline than 
commiting a thousand lines at once. I do believe this change will come for the betterment of my technique. Then, we'll follow along in this cycle:

1. Create a test case
2. commit
3. Try and make a code which satisfies the test case
4. commit
5. Refactor as needed so teacher doesn't put me in a box since the code is unreadable
6. commit
7. repeat until every single thing sir Lana in his video made is also here.

This should take care of the work

## IV. RUNNING THIS PIECE OF SOFTWARE
First things first, make sure python 3 is installed and you do have access to the repository someway somehow. Clone it, fork it, dowload the zip, come steal it from my pc, ask me for a pendrive with the code.

TODO - FINISH EXPLAINING HOW TO RUN THE TEST SUITE. 

## V. DOCUMENTATION
Every code is its own document. Every code must be commented and every comment must contribute to explain the thought process of implementing the class, method, function etc. 

From this point onwards, we'll be using the name convention of foo_bar_fizz_buzz for *everything*. I really do dislike came case and using anything but lowercase in code
rubs me the wrong way.

## VI. CONTRIBUTIONS

Nobody but DOCTOR E. V. is allowed to contribute to this code :)

(Since then i would be getting help for an individual assessment, which is not very great and also not very easy to explain).

## VII. Final considerations
I WILL NOT explain the second introduction UNLESS provided with the FORMAL OR UNFORMAL PROMISE that the truth will stay with the PROMISER.

I WILL delete the second introduction provided a request from DOCTOR E.V., but I WILL NOT renumber the other sections.

Yes, this is a piece of software. Not a great piece, but i do hope it serve its purpose :)
